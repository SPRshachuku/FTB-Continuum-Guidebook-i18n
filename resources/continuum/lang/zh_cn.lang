continuum.logs.name=我是个伐木工，我现在很好
continuum.logs.desc=像几乎所有的整合包一样，你首先要砍树。现在，通过合成制作木板只会给你 2 块木板而不是 4 块，而且你只能制作原版的木板。要获得更多的木板或来自模组的木板，你必须使用锯木机。\n\n任何原木都可完成该任务。

continuum.efab.name=极好的 EFab
continuum.efab.desc=EFab 是一种新型的模块化多功能机器，其工作原理类似于高级工作台。有些物品只能通过 EFab 制作。首先，你需要 EFab 合成终端。\n\n按下“显示物品用途”的按键（默认为 U），同时将鼠标悬停在 EFab 合成终端上查看需要使用 EFab 合成的配方。注意其中一些配方需要特定的升级。要获得石制工具或更高级的工具，你需要兵工厂升级。制作好兵工厂升级后，将其放置在 EFab 的 GUI 中合成格下的 9 个升级插槽中。其他配方可能需要像齿轮箱这样的方块添加到多方块结构中，而不是将升级放入机器的 GUI 中。\n\n另外需要注意的是，有些配方在需要材料的同时还需要时间来制作。你可以通过增加更多的齿轮箱来减少这个时间（最多 4 个，这会将合成时间减少到原来的 25％）。

continuum.tinkering.name=修修补补
continuum.tinkering.desc=现在 EFab 已经搭建好了，我们可以开始使用匠魂（Tinkers' Construct）了。虽然理论上讲只需要 6 个空白模具就可以制作所有的方块和一把能够使用的镐子，但你应该多做几个。

continuum.smeltery.name=熔化器
continuum.smeltery.desc=冶炼炉是一个多方块结构，你可以以熔岩为燃料，制造合金，金属工具部件和齿轮。\n\n将金属放入冶炼炉中，无论是矿石还是金属锭，它们都会慢慢熔化成熔融金属。有些熔融金属会相互融合形成合金，所以如果你不需要这种合金，请注意不要同时熔炼它们。为了将熔融金属从冶炼炉中取出，你需要将其浇注到浇铸台上的铸模上，将与 9 个锭等值的熔融金属倒入铸造盆中以获得该金属的块。每种工具部件以及锭、粒、宝石、板和齿轮都有其铸模。要制作一个铸模，请将 2 个锭的熔融金或 1 个锭的熔融黄铜或 1 个锭的熔融铝黄铜浇注到您想要制作的这种铸模相应的部件上。这个过程将破坏该部件。\n\n这个任务所需要的方块可以让你制造一个内部为 3x3x1 的冶炼炉。冶炼厂的内部最高可以达到 7x7x7。内部空间的每增加一个方块都可以额外增加一个可以放入冶炼炉的物品或方块，以及额外 8 个锭的液体存储空间。\n\n建议尽早开始合成冶炼炉控制器，因为如果只使用一个齿轮箱的话，在 EFab 中合成它将会花费 30 分钟的时间。

continuum.lunch_box.name=多样化就是生活调味料
continuum.lunch_box.desc=多亏了“生活调味料（The Spice of Life）”这个 mod，经常食用同样的食物会使食物提供的回复减少，迫使你多样化饮食。\n\n一个午餐盒可以存储多达 6 种不同的食物，每种食物最多可容纳 2 组，共计 6 组食物。当午餐盒关闭时，右键使用它来打开它的 GUI 并放入食物。潜行时右键使用来开启午餐盒。通过使用开启的午餐盒，你可以直接吃到里面的食物。

continuum.cooking.name=我是厨师
continuum.cooking.desc=因为我们有“生活调味料（The Spice of Life）”，所以我们需要大量不同的食物。“傻瓜式烹饪（Cooking for Blockheads）”是一个能帮助你更容易合成食物的 mod。它增加了一个多方块结构的厨房，你可以存储合成食物所需的原料和工具，并且快速地制作食物。所有的方块必须彼此接触，并且你可以使用厨房地板连接彼此不相邻的方块。\n\n烹饪桌是一种带有合成 GUI 的方块。它可以访问多方块结构中的厨柜或冰箱中的食物和配料。\n\n如果有一个水槽也连入多方块厨房中，那么烹饪桌也可以制作需要水的配方（水槽也可以作为一种为水桶和管道提供水的无限水源）。\n\n如果将Pam's Harvestcraft的工具放入工具架中，那么烹饪桌将能够使用该工具。\n\n烤箱可以制作熔炉的配方以及合成的配方。必须要给烤箱提供煤炭或其他可燃物才能够工作。它也可以一次烹饪多达 9 个食物。\n\n如果你还想要牛奶的话，你可以使用牛奶罐或罐中奶牛。烹饪桌能够使用牛奶罐里的牛奶，手动用牛奶桶来填充它。而罐中奶牛能无限地慢慢产生牛奶。两者都储存 8 桶牛奶。

continuum.coke_oven.name=烤焦了
continuum.coke_oven.desc=焦炉是一种多方块机器，它可将 1 个煤炭转变为 1 个焦炭和 500mB 的杂酚油。要搭建一个焦炉，你需要将焦炉砖摆成 3x3x3 的形状，然后用工程师锤右键你所希望的焦炉正面所在的面的中间的焦炉砖。\n\n要想在 EFab 中制作防腐木板，储罐作为其多方块结构的一部分是必需的。储罐可以储存一种液体多达 10000mB。你可以在一个 EFab 结构内摆放多个储罐，并且可以分别存储不同的液体。在储罐顶部摆放的储罐将会连接并合并它们的存储空间。

continuum.forestry_machine.name=并不是真的用于木头
continuum.forestry_machine.desc=木工机是一种使用 RF 来制作物品的机器，其配方也可以使用液体。在合成格中，使用物品点击相应的槽位中来设置配方。这些物品实际上并没有放入合成格，而是要放入 18 个存储槽中，并且随着木工机进行的合成而消耗物品。\n\n热电子加工台是另一台使用 RF 来熔化玻璃并用它制造电子管和其它物品的机器。将沙子或玻璃放入左上角的槽中，并消耗 RF 将其融化。就合成而言，它的使用方法类似于木工机。

continuum.atomic_reconstructor.name=科技嬗变术
continuum.atomic_reconstructor.desc=原子再构机§1§0§f§§§r使用 CF（与 RF 和 FE 相同，只是名字不同）来将某一种物品转变成另一种物品。\n\n将机器朝向你想要发射激光的方向。激光本身不会改变物品，它会改变激光命中区域周围小范围内的物品。默认情况下，它被设置为接收到红石信号才会关闭；只要没有关闭它且它有能量，它就会经常性发射激光。建议用红石火把右键点击机器，将其变成脉冲模式，此时除非提供红石信号，否则它不会发射。\n\n鼠标悬停在原子再构机上的同时按下 U 键可以查看它的用途。

continuum.yabba.name=YABBA Dabba Doo
continuum.yabba.desc=桶能够存储大量的一种物品，并且在被破坏时也能保留内部的物品。用鼠标右键点击一个桶来存储你手持的物品，或者按住右键点击以存储你背包中的所有同种物品。左键以取出一个物品，潜行时左键取出一组物品。你可以潜行时右键点击桶来打开它的 GUI 并修改它的设置。\n\n你可以使用桶锤改变桶的样式。桶刷则可以改变桶的材质。潜行时右键单击工具以打开其 GUI，然后选择你所想要的样式或材质，然后右键单击桶以应用它。\n\n默认情况下，一个桶可以存储多达 4096 个物品。你可以进行升级，新一级为前一级的 4 倍，钻石升级后最多可存储 262,144 个物品。之后，你可以安装无限容量升级，完全移除最大限制。\n\n此外还有一个漏斗升级，桶安装此升级后就与漏斗类似，可以从顶部自动抽取物品并在底部自动输出，还有了在顶部拾取物品的功能。自动拾取升级将使它能像单种物品背包一样工作，如果有空间，会自动将拾取的物品放入桶中；这在早期对于避免圆石过多导致混乱非常有用。虚空物品升级能在物品满时将放入桶中的物品销毁。这对装圆石的桶很有用，因为当圆石满了的时后，你仍然可以将圆石放入其中，而不是把它扔到角落里。\n\n储物桶连接器可以让你能够§o通过管道或其它自动化形式§r来访问所有与储物桶连接器相连或与桶相连的桶。打开它的 GUI，你可以远程打开其他桶的设置界面。\n\n奇异桶像是桶的另一个极端。它可以无限量地存储不能堆叠的物品。你不能存储堆叠的物品。

continuum.drawer.name=储物用橱柜
continuum.drawer.desc=存储抽屉有三种：能分别存储 1 种、2 种、4 种不同的物品。默认情况下，它们最多可以存储 32 组物品，存储数量在其所拥有的存储位数量之间平均分配。小型抽屉则只有一半的容量。潜行时右键单击存储抽屉来打开 GUI 以安装升级。\n\n抽屉可以安装几个升级。存储升级可增加抽屉的存储容量。这些升级不需要上一级升级，并且可以同时拥有多个相同的升级。抽屉钥匙可以锁定或解锁抽屉，以便只有当前内部存有的物品才能放入抽屉，即使在其被清空时也是如此。\n\n压缩抽屉的特殊之处在于它可以显示了放置在其中的物品的压缩版本和拆解版本。例如，如果你在里面放入了金锭，它也会显示金粒和金块。如果其内部有足够的物品，你也可以将其中的任何一种取出。\n\n抽屉控制器可以让你通过管道或其他自动化方式与所有相连的抽屉交互。与抽屉控制器接触的抽屉（或接触相应抽屉的抽屉）都将被连接。如果你用完了抽屉管理器的可交互面，则可以使用管理器传动方块作为抽屉控制器的扩展。你可以像往常一样通过抽屉控制器手动将物品放入相连的抽屉中，但是无法通过它手动取出物品。

continuum.clockwork_engine.name=提高热量
continuum.clockwork_engine.desc=目前唯一可以制作的 RF 发电机是发条引擎。它并不使用燃料，却需要手动去上发条。对它按住右键来上发条，它就会不断增加热量，你可以从颜色变化中看出来这点。如果它变成了红色，它就会开始对你造成伤害，所以不要对它太过于热情。一旦你放手，它会在冷却的同时开始产生 RF。它运动得越快，它所能产生的 RF/t 就越大。你在一段时间内无法用管道运输 RF，因此必须将发条引擎放置在要使用的机器旁边，直到你获得了更好的发电机和能量管道。

continuum.empowerer.name=某种科学的注魔祭坛
continuum.empowerer.desc=充能台是一个使用 RF 将 5 个物品合并为 1 个物品的多方块机器。充能台本体应放置在由物品展示台组成的“+”形状的中间，物品展示台和充能台之间间隔 2 个方块。给物品展示台提供 RF 并在每个物品展示台和充能台中放入正确的物品，即可开始合成过程。

continuum.grindstone.name=请保持一臂之远

continuum.coal_generator.name=老国王煤炭
continuum.coal_generator.desc=现在我们有了木工机，也就有了电路板，我们可以制作更好的 RF 发电机了。这些发电机能够使用煤炭和其他可燃物而不是手动上发条，所以他们可以在你离开时产生 RF。\n\n煤炭发电机所能产生的 RF 要比生存者发电机少，但它具有更高的 RF 产生速率。生存发电机产生的 RF 要比煤炭发电机多 1.5 倍，但速度要慢得多。

continuum.fluxduct.name=流动的能量
continuum.fluxduct.desc=铅石能量管道是你能够将能量从 RF 的来源传输到机器的第一种方式。用管道将两者连接，RF 将通过管道进行传输。\n\n铅石能量管道每个连接的传输量只有 1,000 RF/t，而硬化能量管道能够达到 4,000 RF/t。

continuum.engineers_manual.name=科技辞典
continuum.engineers_manual.desc=工程师手册是沉浸工程（Immersive Engineering）的指导书。它详细的描述了物品的功能及其如何工作。本整合包所改动的配方可能不会在其中显示。

continuum.crude_blast_furnace.name=更硬，更好
continuum.crude_blast_furnace.desc=粗制高炉可以让你生产钢材。搭建一个 3x3x3 的高炉砖的立方体，然后用工程师锤右键你所希望的高炉正面所在的面的中间的高炉砖。\n\n粗制高炉不能进行自动化地输入和输出。你需要使用焦煤作为燃料将铁转化为钢。

continuum.improved_blast_furnace.name=更快
continuum.improved_blast_furnace.desc=精致高炉可以让你自动化生产钢材。焦煤和铁可以从上方输入，钢可以从前面输出，而矿渣会从后方输出。其结构与粗制高炉相似，但却是使用了精致高炉砖代替了高炉砖且其顶部需要摆放一个漏斗。\n\n在精致高炉的每个侧面，你都可以摆放高炉鼓风机消耗 RF 来加快过程。当消耗 32 RF/t 时，每个高炉鼓风机都能 100% 地加速，当两个高炉鼓风机消耗 64 RF/t 时，其达到最大速度，为初始速度的 3 倍。RF 需要在鼓风机的顶部提供。\n\n精致高炉为 3x4x3（如果安装两个高炉鼓风机则为 3x4x5）。

continuum.tree_fluid_extractor.name=树汁
continuum.tree_fluid_extractor.desc=树液提取器能够提取树液。这种树液被称作胶乳。摆放一个树液提取器使其面向原木，它就会缓慢地生成胶乳且不消耗 RF。它有一定几率会破坏原木，并且这个几率会随着胶乳从原木中被提取而逐渐升高。存储大量胶乳是一个不错的主意。

continuum.conveyor.name=从这儿到那儿
continuum.conveyor.desc=传送带是你可以自动化传输物品的最早的方式（漏斗除外）。将传送带摆下来，它将朝着它面对的方向传输位于其上方的物品。如果可以的话，他们会将物品输出到物品缓存中，但是你需要一个漏斗（或其他自动化设备）从物品缓存中抽取。\n\n有这么几种传送带。卸货传送带下方如果没有任何方块则会将物品漏下，或者如果可能的话将物品放入其下方的物品缓存中。垂直传送带能直接向上传送物品。分流传送带将使每个通过它的物品组交替地向左或向右转。绝缘传送带将防止玩家从传送带上拾取物品。

continuum.schematic.name=全息投影
continuum.schematic.desc=多方块结构投影仪可以让你在世界上看到多方块结构的蓝图。将你的工程师手册翻到你想要查看的多方块结构的页面然后退出。将已经翻到多方块结构页面的工程师手册与多方块结构投影仪进行合成会将相应的多方块结构设置到投影仪中。\n\n手持投影仪时即可看到你所设置的多方块结构，你可以决定你想要摆放的位置。点击滚轮可以旋转蓝图，右键可以放下蓝图，这会放下一些并不存在的“幽灵”方块且能在正常摆放的时候被真正的方块所替代。在多方块结构搭建完成后，潜行时右键投影仪使幽灵方块消失。

continuum.metal_press.name=世间万物压为先

continuum.cable.name=绝缘导线
continuum.cable.desc=这些导线能够传输更高的 RF/t。每一级导线都比上一级更好，随着等级的升高，所能传输的 RF/t 更高。导线等级丝毫不影响机器，它们只会改变传输的 RF/t 的大小。\n\n未绝缘的导线会在有 RF 通过时对你造成伤害，而绝缘电缆不会。\n\n线缆的等级顺序为锡 < 铜 < 金 < 高压 < 玻璃纤维。

continuum.water_wheel.name=被动产能
continuum.water_wheel.desc=水车是一种被动发电的好方法。这意味着它基本上能够免费产生 RF，但其速度不会很快。它是通过放置一个动能发电机，然后将水车放在面向你的一侧而搭建成的。动能发电机就能够产生 RF。\n\n水车根据其上流动的水的量产生 RF。接触它的流动水越多，它产生的 RF/t 就越大。最佳的水的流动方式能使每个水轮产生 30 RF/t。一个动能发电机可以有 3 个水轮相邻放置。

continuum.tool_forge.name=Advanced Tinkering
continuum.tool_forge.desc=The Tool Forge allows you to create more advanced Tinker's Construct tools, like the Hammer and Excavator. It otherwise functions identical to the Tool Station.

continuum.alloy_kiln.name='Allo, Alloy!
continuum.alloy_kiln.desc=The Alloy Kiln is a multiblock machine that allows you to make alloys using solid fuel instead of going through the Smeltery. \n\nCreate a 2x2x2 cube of Kiln Bricks and use an Engineer's Hammer on the face you wish to be the front.

continuum.industrial_blast_furnace.name=Stronger
continuum.industrial_blast_furnace.desc=The Industrial Blast Furnace is a multiblock machine that smelts the toughest metals, like Chrome, Titanium, and Tungsten.\n\nOnce you place the Industrial Blast Furnace, the GUI will have a button that will show you the blueprint for the rest of the multiblock. You can make the multiblock out of any combination of Machine Casing.\n\nThe temperature is based on the combination of Machine Casings. Starting at 0, each Standard Machine Casing adds 40, each Reinforced Machine Casing adds 68, and each Advanced Machine Casing adds 95.\n\nYou can fill the center two blocks with Lava source blocks to add another 500 heat.

continuum.mega_torch.name=Safety Torch
continuum.mega_torch.desc=The Mega Torch disables natural monster spawning within 64 blocks of itself. It does §n§o§r§onot §rdisable monster spawning from Spawners or Cursed Earth, or anything similar, it only stops mobs that would spawn due to low light level.

continuum.electronic_circuit.name=Monty Python's Flying Circuit
continuum.electronic_circuit.desc=The Electronic Circuit is required for pretty much every Tech Reborn machine.\n\nAt this point in the progression you can only use the Infusion recipe. Later you can use the EFab instead.

continuum.transfer_nodes.name=Herer to Therer
continuum.transfer_nodes.desc=Transfer Pipes and Nodes allow you to move items in a much easier and faster way than Conveyor Belts. Place the Node on the inventory/tank you wish to pull from and place a line of Transfer Pipes along the path you wish it to go, and connect it to the inventory/tank you wish to insert into. You can apply several upgrades and a Filter to Transfer Nodes by opening the Node's GUI and placing them inside.\n\nYou can also create Retrieval Nodes that function similarly, but pull from inventories instead of push into.\n\nItems do not go through Nodes like other pipes. Instead, the Node slowly searches for an inventory that it can send items to, and then teleports the items there.

continuum.leadstone_jetpack.name=Onwards and Upwards
continuum.leadstone_jetpack.desc=The Leadstone Jetpack is the first method of flight available. All the tiers of Jetpack have roughly the same flight speed, but higher tiers store much more than the previous tiers.\n\nYou can install Armor Plating on Jetpacks to give them protecetion as well as function. Higher tiers of Jetpack can have higher tiers of Armor Plating.

continuum.drill.name=Pierce the Heavens!
continuum.drill.desc=The Drill acts as a Pickaxe, but never breaks and uses RF. Sneak right click the Drill to open the GUI, where you can install Augments. There are Augments that add Silk Touch or Fortune, increase XP given, increase the mining radius, and let you place blocks down without moving to them. Higher tier Augments require the previous tier also be installed, and you only have 5 slots, so choose carefully which you want. Augments can be removed at any time for no cost. You can also dye the Drill any of the 16 available colors. \n\nPower the Drill using the Energizer.

continuum.industrial_electrolyzer.name=It's What Plants Crave!
continuum.industrial_electrolyzer.desc=The Industrial Electrolyzer creates fluids and dusts from other fluids and dusts.

With RF, the machine will process the items.\n\nThe Electrolyzer is one of the only ways to get certain materials like Chrome (from Ruby) and Titanium (from Bauxite).

continuum.void_ore_miner.name=Metallum Ex Vacui
continuum.void_ore_miner.desc=The Void Ore Miner is a multiblock machine that generates ores at the cost of RF. There are six tiers in total, each giving you more resources faster and costing more RF/t. You can further influence what ores you get by replacing the Clear Laser Lens with a colored one.\n\nThe first tier is 7x7x4, with the Controller taking the top middle slot. Once it's placed, you can use an Assembler on it and it will start to place the other components where they should go.\n\nOnce the Void Ore Miner is constructed, provide RF to the Controller block and it will start to generate ores and place them in any inventories touching it. For the Void Ore Miner to function, you have to have a clear sight to Bedrock from the Laser Lens downwards.

continuum.modular_storage.name=Modular Storage
continuum.modular_storage.desc=The Modular Storage block on its own does nothing, it needs to have a Storage Module inside of it to function. The first tier holds a maximum of 100 stacks, each tier adding another 100 stacks. With the Storage Module installed, the Modular Storage acts basically like a chest. Stacks do not automatically combine; if you put a stack of 32 Dirt and later another stack of 16, they will stay separate. Hit the Z button at the bottom of the GUI to combine the stacks. Above the Z button, you can change how the items are shown, be it a list, two columns, or stacks like most other inventories. The button directly to the right of that one changes the way the items are sorted (you can install a Generic Type Module to add more options). The G button will combine the items into groups depending on the way they are sorted.\n\nThe Remote Storage and its Module allow increased functionality. Place the Storage Module inside one of the spaces for it in the Remote Storage and place the other Module on the right of it, and it will bind them together. You can then place the RSM into a Module Storage (or even multiple of them) and it will access that Storage Module. You can even have multiple Storage Modules in a single Remote Storage, and so long as they all have an ID (they've been bound to any RSM), you can cycle between the Storage Modules by hitting the C at the bottom left of the Modular Storage GUI.\n\nThe Storage Scanner allows you to access all nearby inventories around itself remotely. Set the radius and hit the Scan button, and it will detect nearby inventories. Select an inventory from the list to access it. You can reorder the list using the buttons to the left of it. You can only insert items into inventories on the list that have the star enabled, and then you insert through the blue slot at the bottom left. It will enter the first acceptable inventory on the list, starting at the top. If you wish to specify which items go where, put filtered inventories at the top of the list. You can disable the star at the bottom left and it will instead insert items to whichever inventory is currently selected. You can select "All Routable" from the list and it will display every inventory with a star at once. 

continuum.machine_frame.name=Machina
continuum.machine_frame.desc=You can use Upgrade Kits on Thermal Expansion machines to increase their tier which makes them faster, hold more RF, and gives another Augment slot per tier. The tier list goes Basic -\u003e Hardened -\u003e Reinforced -\u003e Signalum -\u003e Resonant.\n\nCertain machines can have specialization Augments installed that change their function in some way. You can only have one specialization Augment per machine.

continuum.itemduct.name=Pretty Items
continuum.itemduct.desc=Itemducts are generally much better for transferring items than Transfer Nodes. Itemducts will instantly search for a place to send items and they will slowly make their way through.\n\nItemducts default to insert only, you have to apply a Servo where you want to pull from. Inside the Servo's GUI, you can set if it needs redstone to pull, and you can set a whitelist or blacklist. Higher tier Servos have more options and can pull more, faster.\n\nYou can use a Wrench to disconnect two Itemducts from each other so they do not interact.

continuum.auto_efab.name=Weapons of Mass Production
continuum.auto_efab.desc=To automate the EFab, every block on the right has to be a part of the EFab multiblock.\n\nSet the recipe to craft in the Crafter and put the ingredients into the Item Storage. Provide the Crafter with a redstone signal and it will begin to craft. You can have multiple separate Crafters running at once on a single Processor and Item Storage, but you may want to add more Item Storages if you run out of storage space.\n\nThe number of Processors effects the speed that items are crafted.

continuum.void_ore_miner_2.name=Metallum Ex Vacui II
continuum.void_ore_miner_2.desc=The Tier 2 Void Ore Miner can generate a larger variety of materials. To upgrade the machine, you will have to tear the whole thing down, using those parts to create the next tier.\n\nThe Tier 2 Void Ore Miner is 7x7x5, with the Controller as the top middle block. From tier 2 and onwards, you can install various upgrades to the machines by replacing the Null Modifiers in the machine with other Modifiers.\n\nThe Accuracy Modifier increases the percent chance to get ores based on the color Lens and the Speed Modifier decreases the time it takes to generate ores.

continuum.refined_storage.name=Cyber Storage
continuum.refined_storage.desc=Refined Storage allows you to store large amounts of items digitally. You will only be able to store items, autocrafting comes later.\n\nThe Controller is the brain of the system, and also where the system is powered. Everything must be a connected to the Controller in some way to work. Use Cables to connect the Controller to the other parts of the RS System. You can only have one Controller per RS system.\n\nThe Solderer crafts several important items. You can insert and extract from any side. Power it through the Controller. You can install Speed Upgrades into the 4 slots at the top right to make it faster.\n\nThe Disk Drive stores Storage Disks (higher tiers \u003d more items stored).

continuum.translocators.name=Ahorita Regreso
continuum.translocators.desc=Translocators are useful for very fast transfer over a very small distance (in fact, an upgraded Translocator is the fastest way to transfer items and fluids). There's a maximum range of 1 block between the input and the output. \n\nPlace Translocators on all blocks you want to be connected - the Translocators themselves must be in the same block space. Right click the middle of the Translocator with an empty hand to toggle insert mode, and it will pull from Translocators not in insert mode into that inventory/tank. Right click with a full hand and you can set filters on what can get inserted.\n\nYou can use a Glowstone Dust on the Translocator to make it pull a stack at a time, and a Redstone Dust to allow you to toggle insert mode with a redstone signal. \n\nA Diamond Nugget will allow you to set it to maintain the specified amount of the item inside and no more. \n\nThe filter on an inserting Translocator will restrict what can enter, while a filter on an outputting filter will eject items that are not in the filter. \n\nUsing an Iron Nugget will make it emit redstone based on certain factors - on an inserting Translocator it will emit if there's no room for items in the filter; on aan outputing Translocator it will emit if there's nowhere for the items in the filter to go.

continuum.phantomface.name=Transvectorface
continuum.phantomface.desc=The Phantomface allows you to access inventories from farther away than normal. Place the Phantomface in the world, sneak right click on the block you wish to connect to with a Phantom Connector, then sneak right click the Phantomface to connect the two. You can then pipe in to/out from the Phantomface as if it were the block it's linked to, including which side does what. By default, the Phantomface must be within 16 blocks of the block you want to connect it to, but you can increase the range by placing up to 3 Phantom Boosters above it.\n\nThere are also the Phantom Energyface and Phantom Liquiface that allow you to interact with distant energy storages and tanks, and function similarly to the regular Phantomface. \n\nThere are Phantom versions of the Auto-Placer and Auto-Breaker that work almost exactly the same, but instead of placing/breaking the block in front of them they place/break the block you assign with the Phantom Connector.

continuum.storage_crate.name="'Small'"

Later on you can use Advanced Rocket Engines which give much more thrust than the Liquid Fueled Engines do. The Guidance Computer tells the Rocket where to go. The Seat will allow you to ride the Rocket.\n\nThe Rocket Assembling Machine needs to be placed near or on the Launch Pad and provided with RF. With it, you can hit the Scan button to see if the Rocket is able to fly and then you can Build it if it is, turning the Rocket from a bunch of blocks to a single Rocket entity. It will tell you the amount of thrust you have, the weight of the ship, the fuel consumption, and how fast it takes off.\n\nThe Fueling Machine will fill up the Rocket it is linked to with Fuel from its internal tank. Sneak use a Linker on the Fueling Station then use it on the Rocket entity or Rocket Assembling Machine block to link the two.\n\nSneak use the Rocket entity (or sit in it and hit the "Open Rocket GUI" button) and click on the Guidance Computer and insert an unprogrammed Planet ID Chip. You can then hit the Select Dst button on the Rocket's GUI to select your destination by clicking on the body you wish to go to and hitting the Select button at the top left. You can hit the Up button to go up a level to focus on the thing the current body is orbitting. A Rocket alone can only travel between a body and its moons.\n\nDon't leave the planet unless you have enough fuel to get home (you can use a Pressure Tank filled with Fuel on the Rocket to fuel it on the go). If you are ready, you can set off and fly to the moon!

continuum.moon.name=Fly Me To The Moon
continuum.moon.desc=Luna, the Earth's only moon, is a barren wasteland. It's surface is made of Moon Turf, though a few blocks down it becomes Stone with normal ore generation.\n\nIf you explore enough, you might find the Apollo 11 landing site!

continuum.space_station.name=Space Base
continuum.space_station.desc=Now that you have a means of getting into space, you can begin to construct your Space Station. Make another platform out of Landing Pads and construct what you want to send up into space on top. This won't be flown up like the rocket, it will be stored as an item and built later.\n\nOnce you are happy with your Space Station (you can make changes later once it's in orbit), place down a Space Station Assembler like you did with the Rocket Assembling Machine. Put a Satellite Bay and an unprogrammed Space Station ID Chip inside and hit Scan. If the Space Station was constructed correctly, you can Build the Station and the blocks will be removed and stored inside of a Space Station Container inside the Space Station Assembler along with the Space Station ID Chip that is programmed to the new Space Station. \n\nIt is extremely recommended to copy your Space Station ID Chip in a Satellite Builder by putting the programmed one in the center top slot and the unprogrammed one in the slot to the right, then hitting the "Write to Secondary Chip" button, which programs the second one with the data on the first. Store this second one somewhere so you don't lose the ability to fly to your Space Station.\n\nPlace a second Satellite Bay onto your Rocket and insert the Space Station Container, then in the Guidance Computer insert the programmed Space Station ID Chip. You can now ride the Rocket up into orbit and it will land on top of the built Space Station. Rockets that have a programmed Space Station ID Chip will always fly between the Space Station and whatever it is orbitting.

continuum.co2_scrubber.name=Gasp
continuum.co2_scrubber.desc=In case you hadn't noticed, there's no air in space. You might have your Space Suit, but that could run out of Oxygen at any time. You can use the CO2 Scrubber and Oxygen Vent to give your Space Station some breathable air.\n\nPlace CO2 Scrubbers touching two sides of an Oxygen Vent and place Carbon Collector Cartridges in each, and provide the Oxygen Vent with RF. Give the Oxygen Vent a redstone signal (or tell it to work without one) and the air will become breathable. The Carbon Collector Cartridges lose durability over time but should last about 24 real hours.\n\nYou may want to make small airlocks by making a room with 2 Small Airlock Doors where only one opens at a time, one inside the Space Station and one facing the vacuum.

continuum.space_elevator.name=Stairway to Heaven
continuum.space_elevator.desc=The Space Elevator is a convenient way to travel within a system (a planet and anything orbitting it) without having to fly your Rocket every time. You need to have a Space Elevator at both locations, not just one. It costs 50,000 RF to send a player from a Space Elevator, but none to receive a player.\n\nYou have to connect Space Elevators together before you can travel between them. Insert an Elevator Chip into each then connect the two Space Elevator blocks with a Linker.\n\nAs with all Advanced Rocketry multiblocks, you can use different tiers of materials used in the Space Elevator. In this case the Stone can also be replaced with different blocks to make the Space Elevator go faster. See the Holo-Projector for a list of what else you can use instead of Stone.\n\nYou can not use a Space Elevator to travel within the same dimension.

continuum.warp.name=Prepare Ship for Ludicrous Speed
continuum.warp.desc=To travel to other planets and solar systems, you have to turn your Space Station into a Starship. This is done by placing a Warp Core and Warp Controller inside of the Space Ship.\n\nConstruct the Warp Core and insert Dilithium Crystals into the Input Hatch, then place the Warp Controller. In the Warp Controller you can choose whatever planet in whatever solar system you want to travel to. Warping requires more Dilithium if you are trying to reach planets that are farther away.\n\nThe Starship travels depending on the orientation of the Warp Controller. If you place the Warp Controller sideways, the Starship will travel sideways.\n\nPlanets need to be discovered before you can warp to them. You have to have at least 100 of each Data in the Warp Controller before you can scan for a planet, and there's only a 1/2 chance that the scan will be successful. You can insert an unprogrammed Planet ID Chip into the Warp Controller and it will be programmed with the planet you've discovered, which you can then remove and store. You can share programmed Planet ID Chips by inserting them into other Warp Controllers and clicking the "Program from Chip" button to discover that planet without having to scan for it. The planet you discover is randomly selected from all available undiscovered planets.\n\nCertain planets can not be warped to without having the required "artifact" inside the Warp Controller. Insert the artifact into the "Planet Tracking" tab.

continuum.satellite.name=Data Analytica
continuum.satellite.desc=Place the Satellite Builder with a Power Tap beneath it. \n\nAll Satellites need a Satellite ID Chip and a Solar Panel, either Basic or Large. There are several types of Satellites. Some collect Data, some produce energy, and some do some other utility.\n\nThere are three types of Data you can collect: Optics, Composition, and Mass.\n\nInsert the Satellite Chassis into the top left slot of the Satellite Builder GUI, a Satellite ID Chip in the slot one to the right, and fill the IO slots with Data Storage Units, then fill the slots above those with either Solar Panels or Batteries.\n\nTo determine the type of satellite, insert the item for that type in the top right slot. An Optical Sensor will collect data about how far away planets are, Composition Sensors will collect data about what planets are made of, and Mass Detectors will collect data about a planet's mass. A Satellite can only have one of these installed. \n\nTake the completed Satellite and the programmed Satellite ID Chip out of the Satellite Builder and insert the Satellite into a Satellite Bay on a Rocket and the Satellite will be placed into orbit the next time the Rocket launches.\n\nYou can copy ID Chips of all kinds with the Satellite Builder by placing a programmed ID Chip in the top center slot and an unprogrammed one in the slot to the right then hitting the "Write to Secondary Chip" button.\n\nInsert the programmed Satellite ID Chip into the top right slot of a Satellite Terminal to wirelessly connect to it, showing you the amount and type of Data it's collected so far. You can take the Data out by clicking the "Connect" button then inserting a Data Storage Unit and clicking on the arrow pointing down.

Give it Distance Data then hit "Scan" in the second tab. The range is dependant on the type of Motor used and if Glass or Lenses are used.\n\nTo store the coordinates of an Asteroid, insert an Asteroid ID Chip into the bottom left slot of the second tab while the Asteroid you want to mine is selected and click the "Process discovery" button. \n\nThe Programmed Asteroid ID Chip needs to be filled with a lot of Data which is done by inserting it into the bottom slot of the Astrobody Data Processor and filling all three switches in the GUI. 

continuum.asteroid_mining.name=Piercing the Heavens
continuum.asteroid_mining.desc=Now that our Satellite ID Chip is programmed and full of Data, we can begin the asteroid mining mission. This will require a specially built Rocket.\n\nThis Rocket needs to have Chests and Drills anywhere on it in addition to the rest of the normal Rocket things. The more Drills installed, the faster the mining mission is. \n\nInsert the Satellite ID Chip into the Guidance Computer and launch the Rocket using a Rocket Monitoring Station (don't ride it!) and it will begin the mission. In the Rocket Monitoring Station you can see how done the mission is. Once it's done, the Rocket will return to the Launch Pad ready for the next mission. \n\nUse a Rocket Unloader linked to the Rocket to automatically pull the items out.

continuum.quantum_network_bridge.name=Quantum Leap
continuum.quantum_network_bridge.desc=The ME Quantum Network Bridge is a multiblock machine that works in pairs and allows you to connect to your ME System across dimensions and long distances.\n\nFirst you need a set of Quantum Entangled Singularities. These are created by throwing a Singularity and an Ender Dust on the ground and exploding it. This will turn them into 2 Quantum Entangled Singularities. It is recommended to rename these so you don't confuse where they go.\n\nYou need a Quantum Network Bridge at the main ME System and another at the place you want to access it. The multiblock is formed by creating a hollow 3x3 of ME Quantum Rings with an ME Quantum Link Chamber in the center. Insert each of the paired Quantum Entangled Singularities to connect the two.\n\nThe Quantum Network Bridge at your main base gets powered by the Controller there. To power the Quantum Network Bridge at the other end, it is recommended to connect a Controller using Quartz Fiber, which transfer power but not storage data. That way, the second Controller won't be part of the ME System and so won't disable the Controller at your base, but will provide power. The Energy Acceptor does not convert power quickly enough to power the Quantum Network Bridge on it's own.

Build a room or wing for it and place down an Unmanned Vehicle Assembler. On the left and right sides of it, place down Structure Towers to decide how wide you want it to be, and on the top place more to decide how tall it should be. From the top go forward (to behind the UVA) to decide how long the rocket should be. There should be nothing underneath, the rocket needs to have full access to hard vacuum.\n\nInside the area defined by the Structure Towers you can build the rocket. These rockets will be horizontal, not vertical. For gas collection rockets, make sure to include plenty of Pressurized Tanks and some Gas Intakes on as well. Place the Engines on the back of the rocket, and in the UVA you can scan and then build the rocket. Make sure it isn't pointed at the station itself - it might get stuck if it is!\n\nLink a Fuelling Station to the UVA to fuel the rocket, and link a Rocket Monitoring Station so you will be able to see how much time left until the rocket returns from its mission. Sneak right click on the built rocket and in the bottom right corner you can choose which gas to collect. If you aren't orbitting a gas giant there will be nothing to collect, so there's no purpose in sending one out there.\n\nOnce you've chosen the gas you want to collect, go to the Rocket Monitoring Station and click the launch button! The rocket will begin to lower out of the station before launching, flying off into the distance.\n\nOnce the gas collection mission is completed the rocket will return to the space station, no matter if you've moved away from the planet you deployed from. You can automatically extract the collected gases via a Rocket Fluid Unloader that's linked to the rocket or the UVA.
